# Sbt Cross Building Plugin

**Note**: Starting from sbt 0.13.16, the functionality provided by this plugin [has been integrated](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/sbt-0.13-Tech-Previews.html#sbt+0.13.16) into sbt itself. At this point this project is not needed any more to cross-build plugins between sbt 0.13.x and 1.x. See the documentation [here](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/sbt-0.13-Tech-Previews.html#sbt-cross-building).

--------

See the [v0.8.1](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-cross-building/blob/v0.8.1/README.md) tag for the old version.
